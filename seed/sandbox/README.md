## 🔑 UID Conventions

All UIDs have been normalized to simple, predictable formats:

- **Users:** `firstname_lastname` or `firstname_mock`
- **Courses:** `COURSE-CODE-SECTION` (e.g., `AP-BIO-3120-S1`)
- **No date suffixes** - UIDs are stable across imports

## 📝 Using This Data

### For Seeding Database

```typescript
import seedData from './seed/sandbox/seed-data-master.json';

// Access structured data:
seedData.users.parents    // Array of 2 parent objects
seedData.users.students   // Array of 4 student objects
seedData.users.teachers   // Array of 28 teacher objects
seedData.courses          // Array of 28 course objects
seedData.enrollments      // Array of enrollment relationships
seedData.assignments      // Array of 150+ assignments
seedData.attendance       // Per-course attendance records
```

### For UI Mockups
