- Don't worry about pixel perfection

**For Figma:**
- Build navigation first (bottom tabs, header)
- Connect screens with interactions
- Use components for repeated elements
- Test on mobile and desktop sizes

**General:**
- Each prompt is standalone (includes all needed info)
- Use realistic data from personas
- Current date context: Tuesday, October 1, 2025
- Focus on mobile-first (375-414px width)
