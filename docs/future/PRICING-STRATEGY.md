## Context for AI Analysis

I'm building **Modern Teaching**, a modern web/mobile app that provides a better UX for viewing Schoology data (a widely-used K-12 learning management system). The app is currently in development with plans for an MVP launch targeting parents and students in the San Francisco Bay Area, specifically Palo Alto Unified School District and Fremont Unified School District.

### Product Overview

**MVP Features:**
- Complete read-only view of all Schoology data (assignments, grades, courses, announcements)
- Data mirrored to our database for performance
- Parent accounts can view multiple children's data with easy switching
- AI conversational interface (text + voice) to query data
  - Examples: "What's due this week?", "When is my next math test?", "What is my child overdue on?"

**Post-MVP Features (Not in First Release):**
- Executive function planning (sub-tasks, scheduling, calendar integration)
- User data entry and editing
- Notifications and alerts
- Background data syncing
- Teacher collaboration tools

### Target Users

**Priority 1: Parents**
- They control wallets
- No alternative to Schoology currently (Bessy is for students only)
- Will pay for better UX and AI features
- Initial target: 500 happy Bay Area families

**Priority 2: Students**
- Will love AI conversational interface
- Want clean, fast mobile experience
- Should remain FREE tier

**Priority 3: Teachers (Post-MVP)**
- Will use when there's momentum with students/parents
- LTI integration within Schoology interface

### Current Business Model

**MVP Phase:**
- Completely free
- Whitelisted individual users and schools
- Cannot go viral (controlled growth to manage costs)

**Post-MVP Vision:**
- Keep students FREE always
- Charge parents for revenue
- One payment per family (all users get same access level)
- Some advanced AI features gated for students until paid

### Market Context

**Competitors:**
- **Schoology** (official): Poor UX, terrible mobile app, no AI features
- **Bessy**: Student-only grade calculator, popular "What If" feature, but limited scope
- **PowerSchool**: School information system, not user-friendly

**Our Differentiators:**
- Modern, fast UX
- AI conversational interface
- Parent-friendly (no good alternative exists)
- Future: Executive function planning tools

### Cost Considerations

**Infrastructure:**
- Firebase/Firestore (Google Cloud)
- Gemini AI models (Flash for cloud, Nano for client-side)
- Expected costs at scale: Need to model

**AI Costs Example:**
- Gemini 2.0 Flash: ~$0.0001 per query
- 1000 users Ã— 5 queries/day = ~$182.50/month
- Could be higher with more advanced features

## Additional Context

**Solo Developer Note:**
I'm a solo developer building this as a vibe coding project. I value sustainable, ethical business practices over maximum revenue extraction. I want users to be happy and get real value. I'd rather charge a fair price and have loyal users than maximize short-term revenue.

**Values:**
- Students should have free access (education equity)
- Parents paying is reasonable (they're paying for convenience/AI/peace of mind)
- Transparent pricing (no hidden fees, no bait-and-switch)
- Ethical AI use (no selling data, no manipulation)
