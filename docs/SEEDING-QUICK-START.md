# Schoology Seeding Quick Start

**‚è±Ô∏è Total Time:** ~5-10 minutes  
**üìã Prerequisites:** CSV data already imported, admin API keys configured

---

## One-Command Seeding

```bash
./scripts/seed-all.sh
```

This runs all 4 steps automatically.

---

## Manual Step-by-Step

If you need to run steps individually:

```bash
# 1. Create assignments (‚úÖ ~2 min)
node scripts/create-assignments-via-impersonation.js bulk

# 2. Update category weights (‚úÖ ~1 min)
node scripts/update-category-weights.js

# 3. Assign categories (‚úÖ ~1 min)
node scripts/assign-categories-to-assignments.js

# 4. Upload grades (‚úÖ ~1 min)
node scripts/import-grades-only.js
```

---

## Verify Results

```bash
# Show all student grades
node scripts/show-all-student-grades.js

# Test API endpoint
node scripts/test-grades-e2e.js
```

---
