# Next Steps - Immediate Action Plan

**Created:** September 30, 2025  
**Horizon:** Next 7-14 days  
**Purpose:** Bridge from "where we are" to "where we're going"

---

## üéØ Current State Assessment

**What's Working:**
- ‚úÖ OAuth with persistent sessions
- ‚úÖ Basic dashboard showing courses
- ‚úÖ E2E test infrastructure (7 tests)
- ‚úÖ Clean repository (removed 50+ old files today)
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive documentation

**What Needs Work:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Dashboard is bare-bones (just course list)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No grade normalization yet
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited seed data (basic courses only)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è TypeScript errors being ignored
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some code duplication

**Gap to Vision:**
- Current: "Hello World" with real OAuth
- Vision: Comprehensive academic planning platform
- **Gap:** 80% of features not built yet

**This is expected and fine!** We have solid foundation. Now we build.

## üìÖ Immediate Priorities (Next 7 Days)

### Day 1-2: Critical Refactoring (Mon-Tue)

**Goal:** Clean up technical debt before adding features

**Tasks:**
1. **Fix TypeScript Errors** üî¥ CRITICAL
   ```bash
   # See all errors:
   npx tsc --noEmit
   
   # Fix systematically:
   # - Start with API routes
   # - Then components
   # - Finally lib/ files
   
   # Remove error ignoring:
   # Edit next.config.ts, remove ignoreBuildErrors
   ```
   **Time:** 4-6 hours  
   **Success:** `npx tsc --noEmit` shows 0 errors

2. **Create API Route Pattern** üü° HIGH
   ```bash
   # Create: src/lib/api/withAuth.ts
   # Update: All API routes to use pattern
   # Test: Run E2E suite
   ```
   **Time:** 8-10 hours  
   **Success:** All routes use standard pattern, all tests pass

---

### Day 3-4: Seed Data Expansion (Wed-Thu)

**Goal:** Rich, realistic data for testing and demo

**Tasks:**
1. **Expand Tazio Mock Profile**
   - Add 25+ assignments across 9 courses
   - Include variety:
     - Tests (10 points, 50 points, 100 points)
     - Quizzes (short, weekly)
     - Homework (daily, weekly)
     - Projects (long-term, multi-week)
     - Essays (research, argumentative)
   - Add realistic due dates:
     - Past (overdue, completed)
     - Present (today, tomorrow)
     - Future (this week, next week, month out)
   - Add different grading scales:
     - Points (85/100)
     - Percentages (85%)
     - Letters (B)
     - Pass/Fail

2. **Create Carter Mock Profile**
   - Different course load (8 courses)
   - Different grade profile (higher GPA)
   - Different assignment schedule
   - Tests parent-child switching

3. **Add Grading Scales**
   - Standard: 90-100=A, 80-89=B, etc.
   - Weighted: Different categories
   - Custom: School-specific scales

**Files to Update:**
- `seed/sandbox/tazio-mock.json` - Expand
- `seed/sandbox/carter-mock.json` - Expand
- Create: `seed/grading-scales.json`

**Time:** 6-8 hours  
**Success:** Can demo full dashboard with rich data

---

### Day 5-6: Dashboard Widget Implementation (Fri-Sat)

**Goal:** Transform bare-bones dashboard into useful tool

**Tasks:**
1. **Upcoming Assignments Widget**
   ```bash
   # Create: src/components/dashboard/UpcomingAssignments.tsx
   # Features:
   # - Show assignments from all courses
   # - Sort by due date
   # - Filter: This Week, Today
   # - Display: Title, course, due date, points
   ```

2. **Grades At-a-Glance Widget**
   ```bash
   # Create: src/components/dashboard/GradesWidget.tsx
   # Features:
   # - List all courses
   # - Show current grade (letter + percentage)
   # - Calculate overall GPA
   # - Color coding by grade
   ```

3. **Workload Summary Widget**
   ```bash
   # Create: src/components/dashboard/WorkloadSummary.tsx
   # Features:
   # - Calculate total hours this week
   # - Show by-day breakdown
   # - Visual bar chart
   ```

**Time:** 8-12 hours  
**Success:** Dashboard shows all three widgets with real data

---

### Day 7: Testing & Documentation (Sun)

**Goal:** Verify everything works, update docs

**Tasks:**
1. **Run Full E2E Test Suite**
   ```bash
   bash scripts/test-all.sh
   # Verify all 7 tests pass
   # Fix any breakage
   # Add new tests if needed
   ```

2. **Update Documentation**
   ```bash
   # Update: docs/CURRENT-STATUS.md
   # Update: docs/USER-JOURNEYS.md  
   # Create: docs/SPRINT-2-DEMO.md
   ```

3. **Create Demo Video/Screenshots**
   - Record walkthrough of dashboard
   - Screenshot all widgets
   - Update README with images

**Time:** 3-4 hours  
**Success:** All tests pass, docs current, demo ready

## üìÖ Next Sprint (Days 8-21): Feature Development

### Sprint 2 Goals (Oct 15-28)

**Week 1:**
- Parent-child switching UI
- Grade normalization working
- Navigation structure (bottom tabs on mobile)

**Week 2:**
- Assignment detail views
- Course detail views
- Error handling and polish

**By End of Sprint 2:**
- Users can switch between children
- All grades show correctly (points + letters + %)
- Navigation is intuitive
- App feels "complete" for core use cases

---

## üéØ Success Metrics

**Metrics to Track:**

**Development Velocity:**
- Features completed per sprint
- Test coverage percentage
- Technical debt trend

**User Experience:**
- Load time (target: <2s)
- Error rate (target: <1%)
- Test pass rate (target: 100%)

**Code Quality:**
- TypeScript errors (target: 0)
- ESLint warnings (target: 0)
- Duplicate code (target: minimize)

---

## üöß Risk Management

### Risk 1: Refactoring Takes Longer Than Expected
- **Likelihood:** Medium
- **Impact:** High (delays features)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Time-box refactoring tasks
  - Accept "good enough" vs perfect
  - Defer low-priority items

### Risk 2: Breaking Changes During Refactoring
- **Likelihood:** Low (we have tests!)
- **Impact:** High
- **Mitigation:**
  - Run tests after every change
  - Commit frequently
  - Can revert if needed

### Risk 3: Seed Data Creation is Tedious
- **Likelihood:** High
- **Impact:** Medium (slows testing)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Create seed data generator script
  - Use AI to generate realistic data
  - Start with minimum viable, iterate

## üìù Open Decisions Needing Input

**By Priority:**

### üî¥ Critical (Blocks Progress)

**None!** We can proceed with current plan.

### üü° High (Needed Soon)

**D1:** Grading scale complexity
- Start simple (points only) or support weighted categories?
- **Deadline:** Before implementing Grades widget (Day 5)

**D2:** Parent-child switching UX
- Dropdown in header vs dedicated profile page?
- **Deadline:** Before Sprint 2 start (Day 8)

**D3:** Mobile navigation pattern
- Bottom tabs (proposed) or different approach?
- **Deadline:** Before Sprint 2 (Day 8)

### üîµ Medium (Plan Ahead)

**D4:** State management library
- Stay with Context or add Zustand?
- **Deadline:** Before complexity becomes painful

**D5:** Offline mode timing
- Phase 3-4 or defer further?
- **Deadline:** Sprint 3 planning

**D6:** AI provider choice
- Gemini vs GPT vs Claude?
- **Deadline:** Before Phase 6 (Q1 2026)
