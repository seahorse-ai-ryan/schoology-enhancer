# Session Context

This file is used to store the context of our ongoing coding session with the AI assistant. It helps us resume our work after environment rebuilds or session changes.

## Current Problem:

We are debugging two separate but related issues:
1.  **Backend 404:** Accessing the `/helloWorld` Firebase Function on the Hosting emulator (port 5000) results in a 404.
2.  **Frontend Build Error:** The Next.js dev server (port 9000) fails to load the home page (`/`), showing a "Failed to load chunk" error.

## Root Cause Analysis:

The root cause for both issues is an incorrect and incomplete build process. The Next.js SSR function (`ssrschoologytesting`) requires a full production build of the Next.js app (`.next` directory), which was not being created. Similarly, the `helloWorld` function was not being reliably built and deployed to the Functions emulator.

## The Fix:

1.  **`package.json`:** We created a new, unified `build` script that runs both `next build` (for the frontend) and `npm --prefix src/functions run build` (for the functions).
2.  **`.idx/dev.nix`:** We updated the `onCreate` lifecycle hook to execute our new `npm run build` script. This ensures both the frontend and backend are fully built before the emulators start.

## Immediate Next Step:

The user must now **"Rebuild the environment"** as prompted by the IDE. This action is required to apply the changes made to `.idx/dev.nix`.

After the environment is rebuilt, we will test the following:
1.  If the home page (`/`) loads correctly on port 5000.
2.  If `/helloWorld` loads correctly on port 5000.
3.  If the home page (`/`) loads correctly on port 9000.

This should resolve all our outstanding issues.
