# Session Context

This file is used to store the context of our ongoing coding session with the AI assistant. It helps us resume our work after environment rebuilds or session changes.

## Current Problem:

We've successfully implemented a modern, LLM-optimized data architecture and beautiful UI components, but we're now facing a **MSW (Mock Service Worker) integration issue** in the Playwright test environment. The tests are failing because the dashboard content never loads - the `UserDashboard` component is trying to call `/api/auth/status` but MSW isn't intercepting these API calls properly.

## Current Status & Achievements:

### âœ… What We've Accomplished

1. **Modern Data Architecture**: Completely redesigned all data interfaces to be LLM-friendly, RAG-optimized, and protocol buffer compatible
2. **Beautiful UI**: Created responsive dashboard with data source indicators, comprehensive course/assignment displays, and proper loading states
3. **Test Infrastructure**: Built robust test runner scripts that solve the Playwright hanging issue in inline chat
4. **Data Caching**: Implemented Firestore-based caching with fallback to mock data
5. **MSW Setup**: Created browser integration for API mocking (though not working in Playwright yet)

### ðŸ”„ Current Blocker: MSW in Playwright

- **Symptoms**: All Playwright tests timeout waiting for `[data-testid="dashboard-content"]` to appear
- **Root Cause**: MSW service worker not properly intercepting API calls in Playwright environment
- **Impact**: Can't test the complete OAuth flow end-to-end
- **Location**: `src/mocks/browser.ts`, `src/components/providers/MSWProvider.tsx`

## Technical Details:

### Data Architecture Changes

- **Old Structure**: Simple, flat data models matching legacy Schoology API
- **New Structure**: Rich, semantic models with:
  - Academic metadata (difficulty, credits, objectives)
  - LLM optimization fields (embeddings, keywords, summaries)
  - RAG-ready relationships and searchable content
  - Protocol buffer compatibility
  - Backward compatibility maintained

### Test Infrastructure

- **`npm run test:simple`**: Runs Playwright tests with clear output (no hanging)
- **`npm run test:runner`**: Interactive test runner for development
- **`npm run test:emu`**: Jest backend tests (working correctly)

### MSW Integration Attempts

1. **Browser Setup**: Created `src/mocks/browser.ts` with `setupWorker`
2. **Provider Component**: Added `MSWProvider` to wrap the app in `layout.tsx`
3. **Handlers**: Updated mock data to match new data structure
4. **Issue**: Service worker not registering/intercepting in Playwright environment

## Debugging Journey & Analysis:

### Phase 1: Data Architecture (Completed)

- Redesigned all interfaces for modern AI/ML applications
- Added rich metadata and semantic fields
- Maintained backward compatibility
- Implemented comprehensive caching strategy

### Phase 2: UI Components (Completed)

- Built beautiful dashboard with Shadcn/ui
- Added data source indicators (Mock/Cached/Live)
- Implemented responsive design and loading states
- Created comprehensive course and assignment displays

### Phase 3: Testing Infrastructure (Completed)

- Solved Playwright hanging issue with custom test runners
- Set up MSW browser integration
- Created robust test monitoring without inline chat issues

### Phase 4: MSW Integration (Current Blocker)

- MSW handlers created and configured
- Browser setup implemented
- Service worker not intercepting API calls in Playwright
- Dashboard never receives mock data, causing test timeouts

## Root Cause Analysis: MSW Service Worker Registration

The issue appears to be that MSW's service worker is not properly registering or intercepting API calls in the Playwright test environment. This could be due to:

1. **Service Worker Scope**: MSW may not be intercepting calls to the correct domain/port
2. **Timing Issues**: Service worker registration may not complete before tests run
3. **Environment Differences**: Playwright's browser environment may differ from regular development
4. **MSW Configuration**: The `onUnhandledRequest: 'bypass'` setting may be too permissive

## The Fix Strategy:

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Debug MSW Registration**: Add console logs to verify service worker registration
2. **Check Interception**: Verify that MSW is actually intercepting API calls
3. **Environment Isolation**: Ensure MSW works in both development and test environments
4. **Fallback Strategy**: Implement alternative mocking approach if MSW continues to fail

### Alternative Approaches

1. **Direct API Mocking**: Mock the Next.js API routes directly in Playwright
2. **MSW Node**: Use MSW's Node.js setup instead of browser setup for tests
3. **Custom Interceptor**: Create a custom request interceptor for Playwright

## Immediate Next Step:

The user should focus on **fixing the MSW integration issue** as this is blocking all end-to-end testing. Once MSW is working properly in Playwright, we can:

1. Verify the complete OAuth flow works end-to-end
2. Test dashboard data display with mock data
3. Validate all UI components render correctly
4. Move forward with live Schoology API integration

## Code Locations:

- **MSW Setup**: `src/mocks/browser.ts`, `src/components/providers/MSWProvider.tsx`
- **Data Models**: `src/lib/schoology-data.ts`
- **UI Components**: `src/components/dashboard/UserDashboard.tsx`
- **Test Runners**: `scripts/run-tests.js`, `scripts/test-simple.js`
- **Test Files**: `tests/e2e/oauth-flow.spec.ts`

**Note:** The modern data architecture is complete and ready for AI/ML applications. The current blocker is purely in the testing infrastructure, not in the core application functionality.
