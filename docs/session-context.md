# Session Context

This file is used to store the context of our ongoing coding session with the AI assistant. It helps us resume our work after environment rebuilds or session changes.

## Current Problem:

We've been battling a persistent 404 Not Found error when trying to access any Firebase Function (e.g., `/helloWorld`, `/simple-test`) via the Firebase Hosting Emulator on port 5000. This occurred despite the function code, `firebase.json` rewrites, and emulator logs all appearing correct.

Separately, we also fixed a regression where the `/helloHome` page on the Next.js dev server (port 9000) was failing due to a Next.js Turbopack issue.

## Debugging Journey & Analysis:

Our investigation led us down several paths:
1.  **Frontend Regression:** We initially addressed the `/helloHome` error by removing the `--turbopack` flag from the `dev` script in `package.json`, which successfully resolved the Next.js development server issue.
2.  **Testing Rabbit Hole:** We incorrectly attempted to use `npm run test:emu` to diagnose the backend. This failed due to Jest's ESM configuration issues. We briefly pursued this, even considering a switch to Vitest based on an outdated `README.md`, before realizing it was a distraction from the core 404 problem.
3.  **Log Misinterpretation:** Early logs seemed to indicate the functions weren't being loaded by the emulator at all. However, a closer look at more detailed logs provided by the user showed the functions *were* being loaded, deepening the mystery.
4.  **Isolating the Issue:** We created a minimal `simple-test` function from scratch and configured it, proving that even a brand-new, perfectly configured function still resulted in a 404.

## Root Cause Analysis: Build/Startup Race Condition

The final diagnosis is a race condition specific to the Firebase Studio environment's startup process. The Firebase Emulators, configured to start automatically via the `services.firebase.emulators` block in `.idx/dev.nix`, were launching *before* our `npm run build` command could finish compiling the TypeScript functions into the required JavaScript in the `src/functions/lib` directory. The emulators were starting, finding no compiled functions to serve, and therefore correctly returning 404 errors for all function routes.

## The Fix:

The solution was to modify the `.idx/dev.nix` file to control the startup order. We added an `idx.workspace.onStart` hook containing the `npm run build` command. Because Nix processes these blocks sequentially, this ensures that our build script runs and completes *before* the `services.firebase.emulators` block is executed. This guarantees that the compiled function files are in place when the emulators launch.

## Immediate Next Step:

The user must now **"Rebuild the environment"** as prompted by the IDE. This action is required to apply the critical changes made to `.idx/dev.nix`.

After the environment is rebuilt, we will test the following on port 5000:
1.  If `/simple-test` returns "Hello from simple-test!".
2.  If `/helloWorld` returns its JSON payload.

This should resolve all our outstanding issues.

**Note:** We need to revise the `README.md` to correct the testing framework information and document any other key learnings from this debugging session.
