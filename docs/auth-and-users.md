# Auth and Users Architecture (Hello World)

- Login: OAuth 1.0a (consumer key/secret) for end-users; tokens stored in `users/{schoology_user_id}`.
- Admin tasks: Admin API credentials (Manage API) for seeding and privileged reads.
- Parent/Student flows:
  - Parent login: fetch `users/me` â†’ role and possibly `child_uids`.
  - Children listing (real): `GET /api/parent/children` uses user tokens to read `child_uids` and resolves names via `users/{id}`.
  - Active child selection: `POST /api/parent/active` persists `activeChildId`.
  - Child profile read: `GET /api/schoology/child` uses admin creds to fetch profile by child ID.
- Demo mode: Firestore-only personas; no MSW dependency.
