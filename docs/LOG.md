### Morning Session - Modern Data Architecture & Test Infrastructure

- **[ARCHITECTURE]** Completed a major refactor of the data layer to be modern, LLM-friendly, and optimized for RAG applications.
- **[DATA]** Redesigned all data interfaces (`SchoologyCourse`, `SchoologyAssignment`, `SchoologyAnnouncement`, `SchoologyGrade`, `SchoologyUser`) with rich metadata, semantic fields, and AI optimization capabilities.
- **[LLM]** Added embedding fields, semantic keywords, and AI-generated summary fields to all data models for future LLM integration.
- **[RAG]** Implemented structured relationships, searchable content, and protocol buffer-compatible interfaces while maintaining backward compatibility with legacy Schoology API.
- **[TEST]** Created robust test runner scripts (`scripts/run-tests.js`, `scripts/test-simple.js`) to solve the Playwright hanging issue in inline chat.
- **[TEST]** Added `npm run test:simple` and `npm run test:runner` commands for better test monitoring and execution.
- **[MSW]** Set up MSW browser integration (`src/mocks/browser.ts`, `src/components/providers/MSWProvider.tsx`) for API mocking in the browser environment.
- **[UI]** Updated `UserDashboard` component to handle unauthenticated users gracefully and show mock data by default for testing.
- **[STATUS]** Current blocker: MSW not properly intercepting API calls in Playwright test environment, causing dashboard content to never load.

**Key Achievements:**

- Modern data architecture ready for AI/ML applications
- Comprehensive test infrastructure that doesn't hang inline chat
- Beautiful UI components with data source indicators
- Backward-compatible data models

**Next Steps:**

1. Fix MSW integration in Playwright environment
2. Complete OAuth flow end-to-end testing
3. Implement live Schoology API integration

### Morning Session - Environment Synchronization and Frontend Connectivity

- **[META]** Conducted a session review to align on the current state of the project.
- **[ENV]** Confirmed that all Firebase emulators (`auth`, `firestore`, `functions`, `hosting`) are running and correctly bound to `0.0.0.0` as per `firebase.json`, making them accessible from the web preview container.
- **[DIAGNOSIS]** The `/helloWorld` Cloud Function URL is returning a 404 error through the Hosting emulator, indicating a potential regression in the `firebase.json` rewrites configuration. The previous "missing required error components" message was likely a red herring caused by the 404.
- **[PLAN]**
  1.  **Log Progress:** Document the current status and immediate next steps in this log file.
  2.  **Synchronize with Git:** Commit and push the current stable environment configuration to GitHub.
  3.  **Fix 404:** Investigate and correct the `firebase.json` rewrite rule for the `/helloWorld` function.
  4.  **Connect Client to Emulators:** Update `src/lib/firebase.ts` to have the Next.js app connect to the Firebase emulators during development.
  5.  **Implement OAuth:** Once the basic function invocation and client-side emulator connections are working, proceed with the full Schoology OAuth flow.

### Afternoon Session - Test Framework & Emulator Networking

- **[TEST]** Completed a major refactor of the backend testing framework by centralizing API mocking with MSW.
- **[TEST]** Simplified the `test:emu` script in `package.json` to run `jest` directly against the background emulators.
- **[TEST]** Created a global MSW setup (`src/mocks/server.ts`, `src/mocks/handlers.ts`, `src/test/setup.ts`) to provide consistent mock data for all tests.
- **[TEST]** Refactored the `schoology-auth.integration.spec.ts` to use the new global mocks, which resolved test failures and removed redundant local server setup. All tests are now passing.
- **[ENV]** Diagnosed why the Firebase Hosting emulator (port 5000) was not accessible from the web preview, despite being active in the background.
- **[FIX]** Modified `firebase.json` to bind all emulator services to `host: '0.0.0.0'` instead of the default `127.0.0.1`. This allows the web preview container to connect to the emulators.
- **[META]** Confirmed that a **"Firebase Studio: Hard Restart"** is the necessary next step to apply the new host configuration.

### Morning Session - Environment Recovery and Refinement

- **[ENV]** Recovered from a persistent environment failure by aligning `.idx/dev.nix` with a known-good version from the `seahorse-ai-ryan/schoology-enhancer` repository.
- **[ENV]** Key changes and assumptions from this update include:
  - Updating the Nix channel to `stable-24.11`.
  - Specifying `projectId` and `services` for the Firebase Emulator for more explicit configuration.
  - Simplifying the `onCreate` hook to only open a default file, deferring installation steps.
  - Making the preview command more robust by using `"--port" "$PORT" "--hostname" "0.0.0.0"` to work better within the containerized IDE environment.
- **[RECOVERY]** Removed the temporary `tmp-build-faillure-recovery.md` file after applying the fix.

### Morning Session - Vibe Coding Workflow Refinement

- **[ENV]** Corrected a Nix configuration error in `.idx/dev.nix` where `idx.previews` was incorrectly defined as a list instead of an attribute set.
- **[META]** Refined the project's documentation and AI interaction model. Graduated key lessons from `mistakes-and-learnings.md` into `airules.md` and clarified the purpose of `ai-best-practices.md`.
- **[META]** Established a new standard for `LOG.md`: newest entries first with structured prefixes like `[ENV]`, `[FEATURE]`, `[FIX]`, etc.

## 2025-07-22

### Evening Session

- **[ENV]** Restored the web preview functionality by adding the `previews` configuration back into `.idx/dev.nix`.

### Afternoon Session

- **[ENV]** Fixed an environment build error by removing the invalid `import` property from the `services.firebase.emulators` configuration in `.idx/dev.nix`.

### Morning Session

- **[ENV]** Initialized the project and reviewed the file structure.
- **[ENV]** Diagnosed and fixed a recurring build error in `.idx/dev.nix` by removing the invalid `export_on_exit` property.
