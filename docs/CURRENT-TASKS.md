# Current Tasks - Modern Teaching

**Last Updated:** October 6, 2025  
**Purpose:** Atomic action items for current development session  
**Use:** Start every new AI chat by reading this file

---

## üö® AI AGENT RULES

1. **DO NOT estimate timeframes** - No "Weeks 3-6", no "Oct 5-10", no arbitrary dates
   - This is vibe coding, not waterfall planning
   - Tasks get done when they get done
   - Priorities are relative (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW), not time-based

2. **DO NOT refactor code** until testing coverage is complete
   - See `.cursor/rules/core.md` for details

---

## üéØ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Next Session)

### 1. Implement Overdue Assignment Detection ‚úÖ PARTIALLY COMPLETE
**Priority:** üü° HIGH - Critical parent feature

**Status:** 
- ‚úÖ Seed data created with overdue assignments
- ‚úÖ Upcoming widget working with filters
- ‚è≥ Status widget needs overdue logic

**Next Steps:**
- [ ] Update Status widget to detect and count overdue items
- [ ] Show red alert if overdue exists
- [ ] Link to filtered view of overdue items
- [ ] Test with Carter (2), Tazio (4), Livio (2), Lily (0)

---

### 2. Fix requestToken Regression (If Still Occurring) üî¥
**Priority:** üî¥ CRITICAL - OAuth is broken!

**Problem:** `/api/requestToken` returns 500 error with `invalid_grant / invalid_rapt`

**Root Cause:**
- Next.js started WITHOUT `FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST="localhost:8080"`
- Firebase Admin SDK tries to connect to production Google Cloud instead of local emulator
- This violates our startup protocol

**Fix:**
- [ ] Kill current Next.js process
- [ ] Follow `.cursor/rules/workflow.md` startup protocol
- [ ] Use named persistent terminals: `/dev/ngrok`, `/dev/firebase`, `/dev/nextjs`
- [ ] Ensure `FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST="localhost:8080"` is set BEFORE starting Next.js
- [ ] Wait for Firebase "All emulators ready!" before starting Next.js
- [ ] Test OAuth flow end-to-end with browser MCP

**Success Criteria:**
- OAuth login completes successfully
- Dashboard loads with real Schoology data
- No `invalid_grant` errors in logs

---

### 2. Fix workflow.md Documentation Error
**Priority:** üü° HIGH - Prevents future regressions

**Problem:** `.cursor/rules/workflow.md` lines 36-40 have a copy-paste error

**Current (WRONG):**
```markdown
*   **Terminal 3: "Cursor (npm run)"**
    ```bash
    export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17/bin:$PATH"
    firebase emulators:start --import=./.firebase/emulator-data --export-on-exit=./.firebase/emulator-data
    ```
```

**Should Be:**
```markdown
*   **Terminal 3: `/dev/nextjs`**
    ```bash
    export FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST="localhost:8080"
    npm run dev
    ```
```

**Action:**
- [ ] Fix the documentation error
- [ ] Clarify terminal naming convention (choose one: `Cursor (command)` vs `/dev/name`)

---

### 3. Documentation Consolidation ‚úÖ COMPLETE!
**Priority:** ‚úÖ DONE!

**Completed:**
- [x] Removed `START-HERE.md` (outdated "Operation Golden Docs" content)
- [x] Consolidated `docs/INDEX.md` into `docs/README.md`
- [x] Merged valuable content from `docs/QUICK-START.md` into `docs/README.md`
- [x] Updated `.cursorrules` to prioritize `docs/CURRENT-TASKS.md` as #1
- [x] Fixed all paths in `.cursorrules` (`docs/current/ARCHITECTURE.md`, etc.)
- [x] Updated `docs/README.md` with vision, tech stack, MVP philosophy
- [x] Cleaned up page.tsx to remove demo mode and sample dashboard

**Result:** Single source of truth established - all docs point to correct, consolidated files

---

### 4. Remove Demo Mode from Dashboard ‚úÖ
**Priority:** ‚úÖ DONE!

**Completed:**
- [x] Removed sample parent profile switcher (Jane Smith, Joe Wilson, Sarah Johnson)
- [x] Cleaned up `src/app/page.tsx` - single "Sign In" button, no demo mode
- [x] Removed references to DataModeProvider where not needed

---

## üìÖ UP NEXT

### 5. Add E2E Test Coverage
**Priority:** üü° HIGH - Prevents regressions

**Critical Journeys to Test:**
- [ ] Landing page ‚Üí Click "Sign In" ‚Üí OAuth flow ‚Üí Dashboard
- [ ] Dashboard ‚Üí Switch child ‚Üí Verify courses update
- [ ] Dashboard ‚Üí View course details
- [ ] Dashboard ‚Üí Check child selector shows all 4 students

**Use:** Browser MCP tools for testing

**Success Criteria:**
- At least 1 full E2E test passing
- OAuth flow works end-to-end

---

### 6. Generate Seed Data CSVs
**Priority:** üü° HIGH - Needed for Schoology uploads

**Source:** `seed/sandbox/seed-data-master.json`

**CSVs to Generate:**
- [ ] users.csv (teachers, students, parents)
- [ ] courses.csv (course sections)
- [ ] enrollments.csv (student-course mappings)
- [ ] assignments.csv (with realistic due dates)
- [ ] grades.csv (variety of grading formats)
- [ ] parent_associations.csv (parent-child links)

**Tool:** Create `scripts/generate-seed-csvs.js`

---

### 5. Implement Zustand Store
**Priority:** üü¢ MEDIUM - Refactor for cleaner state

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create `src/stores/appStore.ts`
- [ ] Migrate `DataModeProvider` ‚Üí Zustand
- [ ] Update components to use store
- [ ] Test child switching with new store

**Reference:** `docs/STATE-MANAGEMENT.md`

---

## üîÆ SOON

### 6. Dashboard Widgets
- [ ] Upcoming Assignments widget
- [ ] Grades At-a-Glance widget
- [ ] Workload Summary widget

### 7. Course Detail Page
- [ ] Course header with teacher info
- [ ] Assignments list for course
- [ ] Grades for course
- [ ] Announcements for course

---

## üìã BACKLOG (Prioritized)

### HIGH Priority
- [ ] **Re-evaluate API Caching & Rate Limiting Strategy**
  - **Context:** Hitting Schoology's 429 rate limit (50 requests per 5 seconds) during automated testing
  - **Current:** 60s TTL on all cached endpoints
  - **Problem:** Rapid page navigation triggers multiple parallel API calls (grades, courses, announcements, etc.)
  - **Options to Explore:**
    - Increase TTL for less-frequently-changing data (courses: 5min, grades: 2min)
    - Implement request batching/queuing to stay under rate limit
    - Add exponential backoff retry logic for 429 responses
    - Pre-fetch all data on login and cache more aggressively
    - Deduplicate simultaneous requests for same resource
  - **Success Criteria:** No 429 errors during normal navigation, test suite runs cleanly
  - **Notes:** This is NOT a bug in our code, but an optimization opportunity. App currently handles 429s gracefully with 502 responses.
- [ ] Assignments cross-course view with filters
- [ ] Grades overview page
- [ ] Grade normalization (points ‚Üí percentages ‚Üí letters)
- [ ] School year picker (schema support, UI post-MVP)

### MEDIUM Priority
- [ ] AI chat interface (text)
- [ ] AI chat (voice input)
- [ ] Settings page
- [ ] School information page

### LOW Priority
- [ ] Performance optimization (<2s loads)
- [ ] Accessibility audit
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness polish
- [ ] Beta user onboarding

---

## üö® BLOCKERS

**Current Blockers:**
- None! OAuth working, services running, docs organized

**Potential Blockers:**
- Figma/Gemini mocks not created yet (Ryan working on it)
- Schoology sandbox credentials (need admin access confirmation)

---

## ‚úÖ RECENTLY COMPLETED (Oct 5-6, 2025)

## üöÄ NEW SESSION WORKFLOW

**When starting a new AI chat:**

1. **Read `.cursor/rules/core.md`** - Understand DO NOT REFACTOR rules
2. **Read THIS FILE** - See what needs to be done NOW
3. **Check services** - Run `.cursor/hooks/startup.js`
4. **Start services** - Three terminals (ngrok, Firebase, Next.js)
5. **Verify environment** - Run `.cursor/hooks/verify.js`
6. **Launch browser test** - Ensure auth persists
7. **Start working** - Pick top item from IMMEDIATE ACTIONS
8. **Update this file** - Check off completed tasks, add new ones
9. **Journal session** - Create dated journal entry if significant work done

**All without needing context from previous sessions!**

---

## üí° BEST PRACTICES

**DO:**
- ‚úÖ Update this file daily
- ‚úÖ Keep tasks atomic (clear, testable)
- ‚úÖ Reference detailed docs (not duplicate info)
- ‚úÖ Archive completed tasks weekly
- ‚úÖ Use dated journal entries for session logs

**DON'T:**
- ‚ùå Bury TODOs in prose
- ‚ùå Create TODO files with random names
- ‚ùå Leave important insights in journal entries
- ‚ùå Skip updating after completing tasks
