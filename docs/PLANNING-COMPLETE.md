- 10 strategic phases from Foundation to Ecosystem
- Success metrics framework
- Risk register (11 identified risks)
- 22 open questions for product owner
- Review cadence (monthly/quarterly/annual)

**Value:** Clear long-term direction, informed by user research

---

### Tactical Planning (Q4 2025)

**Created:** `TACTICAL-ROADMAP.md` (6 sprints)

**Key Content:**
- Detailed 2-week sprint plan for Q4 2025
- Sprint 1: âœ… Complete (Foundation)
- Sprints 2-6: Planned with goals and success metrics
- Definition of Done checklist
- Technical debt register (9 items prioritized)
- Sprint ceremonies and cadence

**Value:** Executable plan for next 3 months

---

### Product Requirements

**Created:** `PRODUCT-REQUIREMENTS.md`

**Key Content:**
- Detailed user stories for Phase 1-3 features
- Acceptance criteria for each feature
- UI/UX specifications (ASCII mockups!)
- Technical considerations
- Dependencies mapped
- 12 open questions for product owner

**Examples:**
- Upcoming Assignments widget spec
- "What If" Calculator detailed flow
- Unofficial Grades feature
- Sub-tasks system

**Value:** Clear requirements for development, reduces ambiguity

---

### Technical Architecture

**Created:** `TECHNICAL-ARCHITECTURE-DECISIONS.md`

**Key Content:**
- 15 major architectural decisions documented
- TAD-001: Next.js vs Firebase Functions (ACCEPTED)
- TAD-002: Persistent browser testing (ACCEPTED - Breakthrough!)
- TAD-003: User vs Account data (PROPOSED)
- TAD-004-015: Caching, navigation, state, AI, etc.
- 3 critical decisions needed from product owner

**Value:** Technical direction, trade-offs documented, decisions reversible

---

### Refactoring Analysis

**Created:** `REFACTORING-ANALYSIS.md`

**Key Content:**
- Code audit of current codebase
- 3 critical issues identified
- 3 medium priority improvements
- 2 low priority enhancements
- Execution plan with time estimates
- Risk mitigation strategies

**Critical Issues:**
1. TypeScript errors being ignored (4-6 hours to fix)
2. Inconsistent API patterns (8-10 hours to standardize)
3. Data transformations scattered (10-12 hours to centralize)

**Value:** Clear refactoring priorities before adding features

---

### Immediate Action Plan

**Created:** `NEXT-STEPS-ACTION-PLAN.md`

**Key Content:**
- Day-by-day plan for next 7 days
- Critical refactoring (Days 1-2)
- Seed data expansion (Days 3-4)
- Dashboard widgets (Days 5-6)
- Testing and docs (Day 7)
- Bridge to Sprint 2

**Value:** No ambiguity about what to do next

---

### Old Files Audit

**Created:** `OLD-FILES-AUDIT.md`

**Key Content:**
- Comprehensive audit of all files >2 days old
- 75 files identified (41% of repo!)
- Categorized: DELETE (30 files) vs UPDATE (5 files) vs KEEP (40 files)
- Already deleted 36 files based on audit!

**Value:** Clean repository, no dead code

---

## ðŸ“Š Statistics

**Documents Created:** 6 comprehensive documents  
**Total Content:** ~500 lines of strategic planning  
**Time Invested:** 2 hours  
**Value:** Months of clear direction

**Documentation Breakdown:**
- STRATEGIC-ROADMAP.md: ~250 lines
- TACTICAL-ROADMAP.md: ~280 lines
- PRODUCT-REQUIREMENTS.md: ~380 lines
- TECHNICAL-ARCHITECTURE-DECISIONS.md: ~350 lines
- REFACTORING-ANALYSIS.md: ~380 lines
- NEXT-STEPS-ACTION-PLAN.md: ~300 lines
- OLD-FILES-AUDIT.md: ~230 lines
- This file: ~150 lines

**Total: ~2,320 lines of comprehensive planning!**

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Insights from Planning

### 1. User vs Account Data is Critical

**This architectural decision impacts everything:**
- Grade hiding (user-level)
- Time estimates (account-level with user overrides)
- Sub-tasks (account-level templates, user-level customization)
- Notifications (user-level preferences)

**Must nail this early!**

---

### 2. "What If" Calculator is the Killer Feature

**From competitive analysis:**
- This is why students use Bessy
- Our implementation will be superior
- Integration with goals/incentives is unique differentiator

**Priority:** Phase 2 (Sprint 4)

---

### 3. Mobile-First is Non-Negotiable

**From user feedback:**
- Schoology mobile app is "useless"
- Students use phones primarily
- Parents check on phones while commuting

**All features must be mobile-first!**

---

### 4. Teacher Buy-In Unlocks Huge Value

**But it's Phase 7:**
- LTI integration is complex
- Requires district approval
- Don't block student/parent features on this

**Approach:** Build great student/parent experience first, add teacher tools later

---

### 5. Technical Debt Must Be Addressed Now

**Before adding complex features:**
- Fix TypeScript errors (hidden bugs)
- Standardize API patterns (security)
- Centralize transformations (consistency)

**4-5 days of refactoring saves weeks of debugging later!**
