## 🎯 Where We Are

**Milestone:** ✅ Hello World Complete (Sept 30, 2025)

**What Just Happened:**
- Achieved end-to-end flow: Parent logs in → selects child → sees real Schoology courses
- Created `/api/schoology/courses` endpoint
- Updated `SchoologyDataService` for API-first fetching
- Mock data fully seeded in Schoology sandbox (3 students, 2 parents, 12+ teachers)
- Committed milestone to Git (commit: 6a86bdc)

**Current Phase:** Documentation & Testing Cleanup

**Active Work:**
- Phase 1A: ✅ Complete - Deleted legacy docs, created modular AI rules
- Phase 1B: ✅ Complete - Switched from container to native Mac for browser automation
- Phase 1C: ✅ Complete - Removed container artifacts, updated docs for native setup
- Phase 2: ✅ Complete - Browser-first testing infrastructure ready
- Phase 3: ⏳ In Progress - Testing Hello World features with real OAuth

## 🚧 Active TODOs

### Phase 1A: Documentation Cleanup (COMPLETE ✅)

- [x] Delete legacy files (LOG.md, mistakes-and-learnings.md, architecture-plan.md, mock-sandbox-plan.md, quick-reference.md)
- [x] Delete demo mode files (demo-session.spec.ts, demo-flow.spec.tsx)
- [x] Rewrite README.md with accurate current state
- [x] Create `.cursor/rules/core.md` (status, priorities, DO NOT REFACTOR rule)
- [x] Create `.cursor/rules/workflow.md` (dev workflow, testing strategy)
- [x] Update `.cursorrules` (minimal delegator to modular rules)
- [x] Update `.idx/airules.md` (Firebase Studio only, links to .cursor/rules/)
- [x] Create `.cursor/ai-workflow.md` (for human developers, vibe coding guide)
- [x] Create `USER-JOURNEYS.md` (all 11 current user journeys documented)
- [x] Create `CURRENT-STATUS.md` (this file - session continuity)
- [x] Update `product-requirements.md` (v0.1 complete, roadmap to v2.0)
- [x] Delete ai-best-practices.md (replaced by .cursor/ai-workflow.md)

### Phase 1B: Switch to Native Mac (COMPLETE ✅)

- [x] Recognized container limitations for browser automation (no X11 display)
- [x] Switched to native macOS development for full GUI support
- [x] Tested browser automation successfully on Mac
- [x] Decision: Velocity gains from visual testing outweigh container isolation

### Phase 1C: Remove Container Artifacts (COMPLETE ✅)

- [x] Confirmed no `.devcontainer/` directory or `Dockerfile` exists
- [x] Deleted `scripts/chrome-container.sh` (container-specific wrapper)
- [x] Deleted `scripts/start-xvfb.sh` (X11 server for containers)
- [x] Updated `docs/STARTUP.md` for native Mac setup
- [x] Rewrote `docs/CHROME-MCP-SETUP.md` for native Mac (removed all container workarounds)
- [x] Updated `docs/CURRENT-STATUS.md` to reflect native environment
- [x] Ready to test browser automation and proceed to Phase 2

### Phase 2: Testing Infrastructure (COMPLETE ✅)

- [x] Simplified MCP setup (using Cursor's native Browser Automation only)
- [x] Created `tests/e2e/authenticated-flow.spec.ts` with hybrid manual/automated pattern
- [x] Implemented auth-aware testing (pause for manual OAuth, then resume automation)
- [x] Updated `playwright.config.ts` (disabled extra browsers for speed)
- [x] Created comprehensive `docs/TESTING.md` guide
- [x] Documented browser-first testing strategy (E2E > Integration > Unit)
- [x] Tests ready to run in Cursor Test Explorer

### Phase 3: Comprehensive Test Coverage (IN PROGRESS ⏳)

**Goal:** 100% coverage of all 11 user journeys before refactoring

**See:** `docs/TEST-COVERAGE-PLAN.md` for detailed plan

**Progress:** 1/11 user journeys covered

**E2E Tests (Based on USER-JOURNEYS.md):**
- [x] 1. Parent Authentication (with persistent OAuth!)
- [ ] 2. View Default Child's Dashboard
- [ ] 3. Switch Between Children
- [ ] 4. View Course Details
- [ ] 5. View Assignments List
- [ ] 6. View Assignment Details
- [ ] 7. Check Grades & Progress
- [ ] 8. View Announcements
- [ ] 9. Manage Incentives
- [ ] 10. Data Source Indicators (Live/Cached/Mock)
- [ ] 11. Multi-Child Planning View

**Integration Tests:**
- [ ] All API routes (`/api/auth/*`, `/api/schoology/*`)
- [ ] Firebase integration with emulators
- [ ] Cache expiration logic

**Unit Tests:**
- [ ] Data transformations
- [ ] Utility functions
- [ ] Grade calculations
- [ ] Date formatting

**Target:** 100% coverage before refactoring (Phase 4)

---

### Phase 4: Code Refactoring Analysis (AFTER PHASE 3)

**Goal:** Analyze codebase for refactoring opportunities with test coverage safety net

**Prerequisites:**
- ✅ All E2E tests passing
- ✅ 80%+ unit test coverage  
- ✅ CI pipeline running all tests

**Analysis Areas:**
- Component structure & organization
- API route patterns & error handling
- Data transformation consistency
- Cache strategy optimization
- Type safety improvements

**Rule:** NO refactoring without tests! Testing first, refactoring second.

---

### Phase 5: Final Doc Updates & Feature Development (AFTER PHASE 4)

- [ ] Update all docs with testing learnings
- [ ] Create API reference doc
- [ ] Update architecture with any changes
- [ ] Final review and cleanup

### Phase 5: Code Refactoring (ONLY AFTER APPROVAL)

**BLOCKED until testing complete.**

---

## 🔴 Blockers & Risks

**Current Blockers:**
- None - Phase 1A in progress

**Risks:**
- **High:** Core features (parent-child switching, live API) lack E2E tests
- **Medium:** Refactoring without tests could break Hello World milestone
- **Low:** Chrome installation might not work in container (fallback: Playwright)

**Coverage Gaps:**

## 📝 Recent Decisions

**September 30, 2025:**

1. **Chrome Installation:** HIGH PRIORITY - enables Chrome DevTools MCP for AI-driven testing
2. **Firebase Studio:** KEEP - will use for cloud deployment to modernteaching.com
3. **Demo Mode:** DEPRECATED - deleted in favor of Schoology mock data
4. **Testing Strategy:** Browser-first (Chrome MCP > Jest > Playwright)
5. **Documentation:** DELETE legacy files (not archive) - Git history preserves them
6. **Refactoring:** BLOCKED until testing coverage complete
