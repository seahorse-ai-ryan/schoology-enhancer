# Current Development Status

**Last Updated:** September 30, 2025  
**Purpose:** Session continuity for AI agents and human developers

---

## 🎯 Where We Are

**Milestone:** ✅ Hello World Complete (Sept 30, 2025)

**What Just Happened:**
- Achieved end-to-end flow: Parent logs in → selects child → sees real Schoology courses
- Created `/api/schoology/courses` endpoint
- Updated `SchoologyDataService` for API-first fetching
- Mock data fully seeded in Schoology sandbox (3 students, 2 parents, 12+ teachers)
- Committed milestone to Git (commit: 6a86bdc)

**Current Phase:** Documentation & Testing Cleanup

**Active Work:**
- Phase 1A: ✅ Complete - Deleted legacy docs, created modular AI rules
- Phase 1B: ✅ Complete - Chromium installed in container
- Phase 1C: ⏳ In Progress - User configures Chrome MCP in Cursor
- Phase 2: Browser-first testing infrastructure (after MCP configured)

---

## 🚧 Active TODOs

### Phase 1A: Documentation Cleanup (COMPLETE ✅)

- [x] Delete legacy files (LOG.md, mistakes-and-learnings.md, architecture-plan.md, mock-sandbox-plan.md, quick-reference.md)
- [x] Delete demo mode files (demo-session.spec.ts, demo-flow.spec.tsx)
- [x] Rewrite README.md with accurate current state
- [x] Create `.cursor/rules/core.md` (status, priorities, DO NOT REFACTOR rule)
- [x] Create `.cursor/rules/workflow.md` (dev workflow, testing strategy)
- [x] Update `.cursorrules` (minimal delegator to modular rules)
- [x] Update `.idx/airules.md` (Firebase Studio only, links to .cursor/rules/)
- [x] Create `.cursor/ai-workflow.md` (for human developers, vibe coding guide)
- [x] Create `USER-JOURNEYS.md` (all 11 current user journeys documented)
- [x] Create `CURRENT-STATUS.md` (this file - session continuity)
- [x] Update `product-requirements.md` (v0.1 complete, roadmap to v2.0)
- [x] Delete ai-best-practices.md (replaced by .cursor/ai-workflow.md)

### Phase 1B: Install Chrome (COMPLETE ✅)

- [x] Check container OS and package manager (Debian 12, apt-get)
- [x] Install Chromium 140 in container (418 MB)
- [x] Create wrapper script with --no-sandbox flag (scripts/chrome-container.sh)
- [x] Test headless mode (working!)
- [x] Update CURRENT-STATUS.md with Chrome status
- [x] Created CHROME-MCP-SETUP.md documentation

### Phase 1C: Configure Chrome MCP (USER ACTION REQUIRED)

- [ ] User: Add MCP configuration to Cursor settings
- [ ] User: Restart Cursor
- [ ] User: Test with prompt "Check the performance of https://www.google.com"
- [ ] AI: Verify MCP tools are available
- [ ] AI: Document working configuration

### Phase 2: Testing Infrastructure (AFTER MCP CONFIGURED)

- [ ] Create browser-first testing examples with Chrome MCP
- [ ] Document Chrome MCP usage patterns
- [ ] Identify which tests stay as Jest
- [ ] Identify which tests move to Chrome MCP
- [ ] Create `docs/TESTING.md` comprehensive guide

### Phase 3: Fill Testing Gaps (AFTER PHASE 2)

**Critical Missing Tests:**
- [ ] Parent-child switching E2E test
- [ ] Live API course fetching test
- [ ] Cache fallback behavior test
- [ ] Child course display test
- [ ] Switch between children test
- [ ] Return to parent view test

### Phase 4: Final Doc Updates (AFTER PHASE 3)

- [ ] Update all docs with testing learnings
- [ ] Create API reference doc
- [ ] Update architecture with any changes
- [ ] Final review and cleanup

### Phase 5: Code Refactoring (ONLY AFTER APPROVAL)

**BLOCKED until testing complete.**

## 🔴 Blockers & Risks

**Current Blockers:**
- None - Phase 1A in progress

**Risks:**
- **High:** Core features (parent-child switching, live API) lack E2E tests
- **Medium:** Refactoring without tests could break Hello World milestone
- **Low:** Chrome installation might not work in container (fallback: Playwright)

---

## 📊 Test Coverage Summary

**Backend Tests (Jest):** 11 files active (deleted 2 demo files)
```
✅ src/test/admin-page.spec.tsx
✅ src/test/authorize-url.spec.ts
✅ src/test/example.spec.ts
✅ src/test/hello-world.spec.ts
✅ src/test/logout-flow.spec.tsx
✅ src/test/oauth-flow.node.spec.ts
✅ src/test/oauth-simple.test.ts
✅ src/test/oauth.test.ts
✅ src/test/requestToken-route.spec.ts
✅ src/test/schoology-auth.integration.spec.ts
✅ src/test/setup.ts
```

**E2E Tests (Playwright):** 1 file
```
✅ tests/e2e/oauth-flow.spec.ts (mock data UI tests)
```

**Coverage Gaps:**
- ❌ Parent-child switching
- ❌ Live API fetching
- ❌ Cache fallback
- ❌ Complete OAuth E2E

## 🎯 Next Session Prompt

**To resume work in a new chat:**

> "Let's get back to work. Read `.cursor/rules/core.md` and `docs/CURRENT-STATUS.md` to see where we left off."

## 📝 Recent Decisions

**September 30, 2025:**

1. **Chrome Installation:** HIGH PRIORITY - enables Chrome DevTools MCP for AI-driven testing
2. **Firebase Studio:** KEEP - will use for cloud deployment to modernteaching.com
3. **Demo Mode:** DEPRECATED - deleted in favor of Schoology mock data
4. **Testing Strategy:** Browser-first (Chrome MCP > Jest > Playwright)
5. **Documentation:** DELETE legacy files (not archive) - Git history preserves them
6. **Refactoring:** BLOCKED until testing coverage complete
