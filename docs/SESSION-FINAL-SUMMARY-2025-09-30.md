## 🎯 Major Accomplishments

### 1. ✅ Solved "Impossible" hCaptcha Problem (BREAKTHROUGH!)

**Problem:** Schoology OAuth requires hCaptcha which blocks all automated browsers

**Solution:** `chromium.launchPersistentContext()` with system Chrome

**Result:**
- Sign in once manually (pass hCaptcha)
- Session persists in `.auth/chrome-profile/`
- All future tests fully automated!

**Impact:** Enabled real E2E testing with OAuth - game changer!

---

### 2. ✅ Complete E2E Test Suite (7 Tests, <1 Hour!)

**Created:**
- `test-authenticated.js` - OAuth & session persistence
- `test-2-default-dashboard.js` - Dashboard loading
- `test-3-child-switching.js` - Parent-child switching
- `test-4-navigation.js` - Navigation & courses
- `test-5-assignments-grades.js` - Assignments & grades
- `test-6-data-sources.js` - Data source indicators
- `test-7-complete-flow.js` - Complete user journey
- `test-all.sh` - Run all tests

**Result:** Full automated testing of core features
