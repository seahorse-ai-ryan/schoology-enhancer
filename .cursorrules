# Cursor Rules for Schoology Enhancer Project

You are an expert full-stack developer working on a modern, AI-ready educational application. This project combines Next.js, Firebase, and modern data architecture principles.

## üéØ Project Context

**Current Status:** We've completed a major refactor to modern, LLM-optimized data structures and beautiful UI components, but we're blocked on MSW (Mock Service Worker) integration in Playwright tests.

**Key Achievement:** Modern data architecture ready for AI/ML applications with rich metadata, semantic fields, and RAG optimization.

**Current Blocker:** MSW service worker not intercepting API calls in Playwright test environment, causing dashboard content to never load.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Principles

### Data Models (`src/lib/schoology-data.ts`)

- **LLM-Ready**: All interfaces include embedding fields, semantic keywords, and AI-generated summary fields
- **RAG-Optimized**: Structured relationships and searchable content for retrieval-augmented generation
- **Protocol Buffer Compatible**: Clean interfaces that can be easily serialized
- **Backward Compatible**: Maintains compatibility with legacy Schoology API

### Key Interfaces

- `SchoologyCourse`: Academic metadata, objectives, difficulty levels, credits
- `SchoologyAssignment`: Coursework, deadlines, grading, estimated time
- `SchoologyAnnouncement`: Updates, notifications, engagement tracking
- `SchoologyGrade`: Performance data, feedback, analytics
- `SchoologyUser`: Profile, preferences, academic information

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Critical: Never Run Playwright Directly

- **Problem**: `npx playwright test` will hang the inline chat in Cursor
- **Solution**: Always use our custom test runner scripts
- **Commands**:
  - `npm run test:emu` - Jest backend tests (‚úÖ Working)
  - `npm run test:simple` - Playwright E2E tests (‚ùå MSW Issue)
  - `npm run test:runner` - Interactive test runner

### Test Infrastructure

- **Backend Tests**: Jest + Firebase Emulators
- **E2E Tests**: Prefer Chrome DevTools MCP; Playwright only via `npm run test:simple` when MCP is unavailable
- **Mock Data**: Comprehensive test scenarios with data source indicators

## üîß Current Technical Issues

### MCP-First Testing

- Use the developer‚Äôs already-open Chrome session via Chrome DevTools MCP for journey validation. Assert via DOM + console + network; do not use curl.
- Keep `data-testid` stable and emit required console events.

### Linter Errors in Data Service

- **File**: `src/lib/schoology-data.ts`
- **Issues**: Some TypeScript errors related to Firestore timestamp handling
- **Status**: Not blocking functionality, but should be cleaned up

## üöÄ Development Workflow

### Environment Setup

- **Firebase Studio**: Emulators start automatically via `.idx/dev.nix`
- **Next.js Dev Server**: Use "Preview" button or `npm run dev`
- **Ports**: Functions(5001), Firestore(8080), Hosting(5000), Next.js(9000)

### Key Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Start Next.js dev server
npm run build        # Build Firebase Functions
npm run test:emu     # Run Jest backend tests
npm run test:simple  # Run Playwright tests (use this, not direct Playwright)
npm run typecheck    # TypeScript type checking
npm run lint         # ESLint code quality check
```

## üì± UI Components Status

### UserDashboard (`src/components/dashboard/UserDashboard.tsx`)

- **‚úÖ Complete**: Responsive design, data source indicators, loading states
- **‚úÖ Working**: Displays mock data with proper source badges
- **‚ùå Issue**: Depends on MSW working for API calls

### LoginButton (`src/components/auth/LoginButton.tsx`)

- **‚úÖ Complete**: OAuth flow, session management, user display
- **‚úÖ Working**: Redirects to Schoology for authentication

### Data Source Indicators

- **Mock**: Red badge for test/development data
- **Cached**: Secondary badge for Firestore-stored data
- **Live**: Default badge for real-time Schoology API data

## üîê Security & Configuration

### Local Development

- **Credentials**: Stored in `.secret.local` (gitignored)
- **Emulators**: Firebase services running locally
- **MSW**: Browser-based API mocking for development

### Production

- **Credentials**: Managed via Google Secret Manager
- **Deployment**: Firebase Hosting + Functions
- **Security**: OAuth 1.0a with proper token management

## üéØ Immediate Next Steps

### Priority 1: Fix MSW Integration

1. **Debug Service Worker**: Add console logs to verify registration
2. **Check Interception**: Verify API calls are being intercepted
3. **Environment Isolation**: Test MSW in development vs. test environment
4. **Alternative Approach**: Consider direct API route mocking if MSW continues to fail

### Priority 2: Complete OAuth Testing

1. **Verify Dashboard Loading**: Ensure components render with mock data
2. **Test Authentication Flow**: Complete end-to-end OAuth testing
3. **Validate Data Display**: Test all UI components with various data sources

### Priority 3: Technical Debt

1. **Fix Linter Errors**: Clean up TypeScript issues in data service
2. **Error Boundaries**: Implement comprehensive error handling
3. **Performance**: Optimize MSW handlers and data loading

## üö® Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Playwright Usage

- **‚ùå Don't**: Run `npx playwright test` directly
- **‚úÖ Do**: Use `npm run test:simple` or `npm run test:runner` only when MCP is unavailable

### MSW Not Working

- **Check**: Browser console for service worker registration
- **Verify**: API calls are being intercepted
- **Fallback**: Consider direct API route mocking

### Firebase Functions 404

- **Check**: Functions are built (`npm run build`)
- **Verify**: Emulators are running and accessible
- **Reset**: Use "Firebase Studio: Hard Restart" if needed

## üìö Key Documentation Files

## üß† AI/ML Readiness

### Current Capabilities

- **Data Structure**: Rich, semantic models ready for LLM processing
- **Embedding Fields**: Pre-configured for vector database integration
- **RAG Optimization**: Structured relationships for retrieval-augmented generation
- **Protocol Buffers**: Clean interfaces for data serialization

### Future Opportunities

- **LLM Integration**: Embedding generation, semantic search, AI recommendations
- **Advanced Analytics**: Learning analytics, predictive deadline management
- **Intelligent Planning**: AI-powered study recommendations and time management

## üí° Key Learnings from This Session

### MSW Integration Complexity

- **Browser vs Node**: MSW behaves differently in browser vs. Node.js environments
- **Service Worker Registration**: Timing and scope issues in Playwright
- **Environment Isolation**: Development vs. test environment differences

### Test Infrastructure Design

- **Inline Chat Compatibility**: Direct Playwright commands hang Cursor's inline chat
- **Custom Test Runners**: Essential for maintaining development workflow
- **Clear Output**: Test results must be easily readable and actionable

### Modern Data Architecture Benefits

- **LLM Readiness**: Rich metadata enables immediate AI integration
- **RAG Optimization**: Structured relationships improve search and retrieval
- **Backward Compatibility**: Can maintain legacy API support while adding modern features

**Remember**: You're working on a cutting-edge, AI-ready educational application. The current blocker is in the testing infrastructure, not the core functionality. Focus on getting MSW working in Playwright so we can validate the complete OAuth flow and move to live API integration.
