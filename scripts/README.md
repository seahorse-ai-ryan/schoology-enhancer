## üìù Important Notes

### Super Teacher Account

**ID:** `140836120`  
**school_uid:** `super_teacher_20250930`

This account is enrolled in all courses and is used for API impersonation when creating/updating content.

### Student IDs

- Carter Mock: `140834636`
- Tazio Mock: `140834637`
- Livio Mock: `140834638`
- Lily Mock: `140834639`

### Parent IDs

- Christina Mock: `140834634`
- Ryan Mock: `140834635`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues

### "Admin credentials not configured"

**Fix:** Ensure `.env.local` has:
```bash
SCHOOLOGY_ADMIN_KEY=your_key
SCHOOLOGY_ADMIN_SECRET=your_secret
```

### "Section not found"

**Fix:** Verify sections were created via CSV upload first.

### "Category not found"

**Fix:** Categories must be created in Schoology UI. Cannot be created via API.

### Rate limiting (429 errors)

**Fix:** Scripts include 100ms delays. If you still hit limits, increase the delay.

## üßπ Cleanup Scripts

**Note:** Most temporary test scripts have been cleaned up. If you see scripts not documented here, they may be obsolete and can be removed.

**Keep these:**
- All seeding scripts (create-assignments, update-category-weights, etc.)
- All verification scripts (show-all-student-grades, check-assignments-grades, etc.)
- All E2E test scripts (test-*.js)
- Utility scripts (start-emulators.js, generate-seed-csvs.js, etc.)

**Can be removed:**
- Any scripts with "temp", "debug", or "test" in the name that aren't documented above
- Scripts that duplicate functionality of working scripts
