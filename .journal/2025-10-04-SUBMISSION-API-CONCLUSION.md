# Submission API - Final Conclusion
## Oct 4, 2025

### Complete Testing Summary

We tested **every possible approach** to create submissions via API:

#### Test 1: Teacher Impersonation
```
X-Schoology-Run-As: {teacher_id}
POST /v1/sections/{section_id}/submissions/{assignment_id}/users/{user_id}
Result: 403 Forbidden
```

#### Test 2: Student Impersonation  
```
X-Schoology-Run-As: {student_id}
POST /v1/sections/{section_id}/submissions/{assignment_id}/users/{user_id}
Result: 403 Forbidden
```
*Enabled Student impersonation checkbox in Schoology admin - still 403*

#### Test 3: Student's Own API Keys (No Impersonation)
```
Using: SCHOOLOGY_CONSUMER_KEY_carter_mock + SECRET
POST /v1/sections/{section_id}/submissions/{assignment_id}/users/{user_id}
Result: 403 Forbidden
```

### Critical Finding

**Even a student's own API keys cannot create submissions programmatically.**

This means the 403 is **not** about:
- ❌ Impersonation permissions
- ❌ Wrong user type
- ❌ Admin vs student credentials

The 403 is because:
- ✅ **Schoology API does not support programmatic submission creation**

### Why This Makes Sense

Submissions in Schoology represent **actual student work**:
- Files uploaded
- Text responses
- Links submitted
- Actual content

An empty POST creating a "placeholder" submission goes against Schoology's data model. They likely want:
1. Students submit actual work via UI
2. Or use their Dropbox/Materials system
3. Or teachers manually create submissions when entering grades

### Impact on Our Seeding

**What works programmatically:**
- ✅ Users (CSV)
- ✅ Courses (CSV)
- ✅ Enrollments (CSV)
- ✅ Parent associations (CSV)
- ✅ Assignments (API with teacher impersonation)
- ✅ Grades (API with teacher impersonation)

**What doesn't work programmatically:**
- ❌ Submissions (API blocked - returns 403 for all approaches)

**Result:**
- Grades exist in API ✅
- Grades invisible in UI ❌ (need submissions)

### Official Workaround

**Manual grade entry** (5-10 minutes):
1. Teacher navigates to assignment in Schoology UI
2. Clicks "Grade Submissions"
3. Enters any grade for any student
4. This auto-creates submission for that assignment
5. All programmatic grades become visible

**One manual action per assignment** unlocks all bulk grades for that assignment.

### Recommendation

**Accept this limitation:**
- Seeding requires one manual step per assignment
- Document clearly in SEEDING-OVERVIEW.md
- In production, students create submissions naturally
- This is only a dev/testing inconvenience

**Do NOT pursue further:**
- ❌ More API endpoint variations
- ❌ Different authentication methods
- ❌ Contacting Schoology support (likely "working as designed")

**Focus instead on:**
- ✅ Creating excellent bulk assignment/grade scripts
- ✅ Clear documentation for manual submission step
- ✅ Building out actual app features

---

**Conclusion:** Schoology intentionally restricts programmatic submission creation. Accept manual workaround for seeding.
