# GEMINI FINAL AUDIT - October 4, 2025

**Purpose:** This document is the definitive audit of the `.journal/` directory. It extracts all valuable, undocumented information, decisions, and open questions before the journal is archived. This ensures no critical context from the initial planning and setup phases is lost.

---

##  actionable, undocumented items

1.  **Adopt "Named Persistent Terminals" Strategy**
    *   **Insight:** A workflow from `GPT5-CODEX-PRODUCTIVITY-PLAN.md` to prevent AI agents from creating conflicting server processes by reusing named terminals (e.g., `/dev/firebase`).
    *   **Status:** ‚ùå **Not Documented.** The current `.cursor/rules/workflow.md` does not mention this protocol.
    *   **Action:** Add this strategy to `.cursor/rules/workflow.md` to improve development stability.

    ##Ryan feedback: Yes, we must get the startup sequence right. We recently created Hooks (see changelog https://cursor.com/changelog/1-7) and that may be the right way to do this but our workflow rule isn't aware. Please investigate.

2.  **Formalize "Student Privacy vs. Parent Oversight" Decision**
    *   **Insight:** Your decision in `My-Decisions-Ryan_2025-10-01.md` is to make user-added data "shared by default, with an option to hide."
    *   **Status:** ‚ùå **Not Formally Documented.** The main `docs/roadmaps/PRODUCT-DECISIONS.md` does not yet contain this crucial product philosophy.
    *   **Action:** Add this decision as a formal section in `docs/roadmaps/PRODUCT-DECISIONS.md`.

     ##Ryan feedback: Yes, this is very important and must be captured.

3.  **Create Customer Support Plan**
    *   **Insight:** The audit identified that there is no formal plan for handling bug reports or user feedback.
    *   **Status:** ‚ùå **Gap Identified.** No corresponding document exists.
    *   **Action:** Create a new document at `docs/guides/CUSTOMER-SUPPORT-PLAN.md` outlining the MVP strategy (e.g., feedback form, support email).

     ##Ryan feedback: Very important. I want you to investigate if hosting this app on Firebase offers us any native ways of accepting and monitoring customer complaints, bugs, or other feedback. If not, make a simple proposal for handling this in the short term. My gut instinct says to create a support@modernteaching.com address and put it in the "About" page, or make a "Contact Us" page.

4.  **Create Data Backup & Restoration Plan**
    *   **Insight:** The audit identified a gap in planning for data recovery in case of corruption or disaster.
    *   **Status:** ‚ùå **Gap Identified.** No corresponding document exists.
    *   **Action:** Add a "Data Backup and Restoration" section to `docs/current/ARCHITECTURE.md` outlining the strategy (e.g., Firestore automatic backups, recovery procedures).

     ##Ryan feedback: Yes, very important to have this. Related, there's a disconnect in how we use local Firebase emulator data vs production. I'm not entirely clear if our local data is entirely ephemeral from each time we start the emulators or persistent, which I hope it would be. We don't back that up either nd it's essentially our "DEV" instance and we'll want BETA and PROD so we can test deployment of new features before touching production users.

5.  **Re-evaluate "Offline-First" as a Strategic Priority**
    *   **Insight:** Gemini's review argued strongly for making the PWA offline-capable from Phase 1 as a key differentiator, which contradicts the current roadmap.
    *   **Status:** ‚ùå **Contradiction Not Resolved.** Your decisions file opts for performance caching, but the strategic argument from the journal warrants a formal review.
    *   **Action:** Add a new decision entry in `docs/roadmaps/TECHNICAL-ARCHITECTURE-DECISIONS.md` that explicitly addresses and decides on the "Offline-First" strategy, weighing the pros (differentiator) and cons (complexity).

     ##Ryan feedback: Our users are never truly "offline", and when they are it's OK the app doesn't work. We do want a performant app and we want to lower cloud costs by reducing API calls, so caching server-side and client-side data makes sense. We absolutely do NOT need the users entering or modifying offline data that would then need to sync to the cloud when they have a connection again.

6.  **Incorporate Advanced Firestore Architecture**
    *   **Insight:** Gemini's review suggested creating pre-aggregated "view" documents in Firestore (e.g., `/user_dashboards/{userId}`) to dramatically reduce reads and costs.
    *   **Status:** ‚ùå **Not Documented.** The current `docs/current/ARCHITECTURE.md` describes a normalized structure but does not include this vital optimization pattern.
    *   **Action:** Update the "Data Flow Architecture" and "Data Models" sections in `docs/current/ARCHITECTURE.md` to include this denormalized "view document" strategy.

     ##Ryan feedback: Expand on the value prop for this. I could see it being especially useful when we do async data checks for Schoology updates even when our users aren't active in the app. We'll do this down the road and it will enable us to trigger notifications to users. I could see us updting some kind of view page if it aggregates data across multiple schema structures. This will improve performance but I'm not sure it saves us much else vs the overhead because we'll cache the data when a user logs in. W emay also make frequent UI layout changes as our fast evolving app improves and I'm very eager to imagine a future where users personalize their dashboards using AI parsed instructions where Gemini Nano might reformat the data to meet the user's wishes.

## üí° II. Undocumented Insights & Open Questions (Verified)

This section synthesizes the most valuable information from the audit that has been **verified** as not yet present in the final `/docs`.

### Key Undocumented Strategies

1.  **Offline-First Architecture (from Gemini):** A proposal to make the PWA offline-capable from Phase 1 as a key differentiator.
    *   **Verification:** `docs/roadmaps/TECHNICAL-ARCHITECTURE-DECISIONS.md` does not address this as a strategic choice. `My-Decisions-Ryan_2025-10-01.md` decides against *full* offline but favors aggressive caching, creating a conflict that needs formal resolution.

2.  **Contract Testing (from GPT-5):** A testing layer that runs nightly to check for breaking changes in the Schoology API schema.
    *   **Verification:** `docs/guides/TESTING.md` outlines E2E, Integration, and Unit tests but does not include this concept.

3.  **Named Persistent Terminals (from GPT-5 Codex):** A workflow to instruct AI agents to reuse named terminals to prevent server conflicts.
    *   **Verification:** `.cursor/rules/workflow.md` details the startup sequence but does not contain this protocol for agent behavior.

4.  **Firestore "View" Documents (from Gemini):** An optimization strategy to create pre-aggregated documents to reduce database reads.
    *   **Verification:** `docs/current/ARCHITECTURE.md` describes a normalized data model but does not include this important denormalization strategy for performance and cost savings.

### Open Decisions & Unanswered Questions (Verified)

1.  **Student Privacy vs. Parent Oversight (from Gemini):** What is the definitive product philosophy?
    *   **Verification:** `My-Decisions-Ryan_2025-10-01.md` provides a clear direction ("shared by default, with an option to hide"), but this has not been transferred to the official `docs/roadmaps/PRODUCT-DECISIONS.md`.

2.  **What-If Calculator Accuracy (from Meta-Analysis):** What is the acceptable accuracy bar for launch?
    *   **Verification:** `My-Decisions-Ryan_2025-10-01.md` states this is "not in our MVP." `docs/roadmaps/MVP-PLAN.md` correctly lists it as "Out of Scope." This is resolved.

3.  **Customer Support Plan (from AI-DRIVEN-WORKFLOW-AND-AUDIT):** What is the strategy for handling bug reports and user feedback?
    *   **Verification:** A file search confirms no `CUSTOMER-SUPPORT-PLAN.md` or similar document exists. This is a gap.

4.  **Data Backup & Restoration (from AI-DRIVEN-WORKFLOW-AND-AUDIT):** What is the plan for recovering from data corruption?
    *   **Verification:** `docs/current/ARCHITECTURE.md` does not currently have a section covering this. This is a gap.

## ‚úÖ III. Final Recommendations

1.  **Incorporate Undocumented Strategies:** The four key strategies (Offline-First, Contract Testing, Named Terminals, View Documents) are significant enhancements. They should be formally added to the relevant documentation as proposed above.

2.  **Resolve Open Questions:** The Product Owner should provide definitive answers for the open questions, especially regarding the Customer Support and Data Backup plans. These decisions should be added to `docs/roadmaps/PRODUCT-DECISIONS.md`.

3.  **Final Cross-Reference:** A final pass should be made to ensure the key decisions from `My-Decisions-Ryan_2025-10-01.md` (like the privacy model) have been fully and accurately translated into the formal planning documents.

4.  **Archive the Journal:** Once the above actions are complete, the `.journal/` directory has served its purpose. Its contents can be safely archived or deleted, providing a clean slate for future work logs, knowing that all valuable context has been preserved.
