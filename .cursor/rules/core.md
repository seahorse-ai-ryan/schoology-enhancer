# Modern Teaching - Core Context

**Project Name:** Modern Teaching (formerly Schoology Enhancer)  
**Repository:** https://github.com/seahorse-ai-ryan/schoology-enhancer  
**Deployment:** Firebase Hosting (modernteaching.com - planned)

---

## Current Status (September 30, 2025)

### ‚úÖ Hello World Milestone Achieved

**Complete E2E Flow:**
1. Parent logs in with real Schoology OAuth credentials
2. Selects child (Carter, Tazio, or Livio Mock) from profile menu
3. Dashboard fetches and displays child's courses from Schoology API
4. Data cached to Firestore for offline access

**What Works:**
- OAuth 1.0a authentication flow
- Parent-child account associations
- Real-time course data fetching (`/api/schoology/courses`)
- Firestore caching with offline support
- Dashboard displaying live student courses with teacher names
- Mock data CSV bulk import to Schoology sandbox
- Static ngrok domain for stable development

---

## Next Priority (v0.2 - Smart Caching)

‚è≥ **DO NOT REFACTOR CODE** until testing coverage is complete.

**Current Focus:**
1. Install Chrome in container for Cursor Browser + Chrome DevTools MCP
2. Implement browser-first testing strategy
3. Fill testing gaps for Hello World features (parent-child switching, live API, cache fallback)
4. **ONLY THEN** consider code refactoring

**Upcoming Features:**
- TTL-based staleness checks (1min dev, 10min test, 1hr prod)
- `/api/schoology/assignments` endpoint
- `/api/schoology/announcements` endpoint
- Manual refresh button on dashboard

---

## Development Environments

### Primary: Cursor on Mac (Daily Development)
- Local development with ngrok
- Chrome DevTools MCP for browser testing
- Firebase Emulators for backend
- All feature development happens here

### Secondary: Firebase Studio (Cloud Deployment)
- Deploy to Firebase Hosting
- Manage cloud resources
- Production debugging
- See `.idx/airules.md` for Studio-specific rules

## Key Achievements

1. **Real E2E Flow:** Parent ‚Üí Select Child ‚Üí View Courses
2. **Modern Data Architecture:** LLM-ready models with semantic fields, RAG optimization
3. **Offline Support:** Smart caching with Firestore fallbacks
4. **Mock Data Pipeline:** CSV bulk import to Schoology sandbox
5. **Static Dev Domain:** modernteaching.ngrok.dev (no manual URL updates)

## Critical Rules for AI Agents

### üö´ DO NOT Touch Code Yet

**No code refactoring without explicit approval.**

Testing coverage must be complete first to prevent regressions.

### ‚úÖ Current Work Focus

**Allowed:**
- Documentation updates
- Test creation
- Chrome installation
- Testing infrastructure

**Not Allowed:**
- Code refactoring
- Architectural changes
- Feature additions (unless explicitly requested)

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js 14, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Firebase Functions, Next.js API Routes
- **Database:** Firestore
- **Auth:** Schoology OAuth 1.0a
- **Testing:** Chrome DevTools MCP, Jest, Playwright
- **Deploy:** Firebase Hosting + Functions
