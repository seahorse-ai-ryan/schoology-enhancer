I am a new AI agent starting a chat session to work on a side task in parallel. I understand that the main development environment is already running correctly and is being managed in another chat.

My primary instruction is: **DO NOT touch the development environment.** I will not start, stop, restart, or otherwise manage any of the development services (ngrok, Firebase, Next.js). I will not run any tests that require a browser.

My task is to focus only on the specific instructions I receive.

I will now read `.cursor/rules/core.md` and `docs/CURRENT-TASKS.md` to get my bearings on the project status, and then I will await instructions for my specific side task.
