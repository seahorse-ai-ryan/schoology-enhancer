# Debugging Firebase Hosting to Cloud Functions 404 Errors in Firebase Studio

The primary reason for 404 errors when routing Firebase Hosting to Cloud Functions within the Firebase Studio (formerly Project IDX) emulators is a misconfiguration in the `firebase.json` file or a misunderstanding of how the emulators serve content.

Here is a summary of the key findings for debugging these issues.

### Common Causes of 404 Errors

The most frequent cause of a 404 error is an incorrect `firebase.json` configuration. The emulators strictly follow these rules to determine whether to serve a static file from the public directory or rewrite the request to a Cloud Function.

1. **Incorrect `"rewrites"` Configuration:** The `"rewrites"` rule must correctly specify the `"source"` path and the `"function"` name. A common mistake is a typo in the function name or an overly broad source pattern that conflicts with static assets.

2. **Function Not Triggered:** The Cloud Function needs to be an **HTTP Request-triggered function** (using `onRequest`) for Hosting rewrites to work. If the function is not of the correct type (e.g., `onCall`), it won't have an HTTP endpoint for the Hosting emulator to forward the request to.

3. **Emulator Not Running:** Ensure that both the Hosting and Functions emulators were started correctly. In Firebase Studio, this is typically handled by the `firebase emulators:start` command. If the Functions emulator fails to start, any rewrite will result in a 404.

### Verifying the Functions Emulator

You can confirm that your functions are deployed and running correctly in the local emulator by checking the **Emulator Suite UI**.

* When you start the emulators, a log message provides a URL for the UI, typically `http://127.0.0.1:4000`.

* Open this URL in your browser inside Firebase Studio.

* Navigate to the **Functions** tab. You should see a list of all your deployed functions with their names, types (e.g., HTTPS), and the local URL they are served at. If your function is not on this list, it was not deployed correctly.

### Accessing Emulator Logs

The most direct way to diagnose errors is by checking the logs.

* In the Firebase Studio terminal where you ran `firebase emulators:start`, the combined logs for all emulators are streamed.

* Look for the **"functions:"** prefix in the logs. This will show function execution start/end times, any `console.log` statements from your code, and crucially, any runtime errors that occurred within the function itself. A 404 from the browser might correspond to a specific error in this log.

### Next.js and Firebase Hosting

For Next.js applications, a key issue is the potential conflict between Next.js's client-side routing and Firebase Hosting's server-side rewrite rules.

* In your `firebase.json`, ensure that your function rewrites do **not** conflict with Next.js page routes. It is a common practice to prefix all API function routes, for example, with `/api/*`.

* This cleanly separates your Next.js app's page URLs from your backend API endpoints.

### Example `firebase.json` Configuration

This example correctly routes all requests made to `/api/**` to a function named `api`, while letting the Hosting emulator serve all other requests (which would typically be handled by your web framework like Next.js or a static `index.html`).

```
{
  "hosting": {
    "public": "out",
    "ignore": [
      "firebase.json",
      "**/.*",
      "**/node_modules/**"
    ],
    "rewrites": [
      {
        "source": "/api/**",
        "function": "api"
      },
      {
        "source": "**",
        "destination": "/index.html"
      }
    ]
  },
  "functions": {
    "source": "functions"
  }
}

```
